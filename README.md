# Download and play!
Download the folder titled 'Game' above. This contains the application titled 'Fractured Flight' which you run, and the data it needs (things like assets and save data). Make sure you keep the application and the data together or the game won't be playable.

If you are familiar with Git, you could clone the entire directory if that's easier, but you only need the contents of the Game folder in the root of the repository to play.

# Fractured Flight
This is a 2D platformer I began developing in Unity in the summer of 2025. You play as a dimorphodon (a small flying reptile) who begins injured with its family in the jungle. As you progress through different environments, you slowly regain your strength, unlock new movement abilities like gliding and wall climbing, and navigate toward safety and reunion with your family.

# Credits
I would not have been able to complete this project on my own. Thanks to the help of a very talented artist, Vanessa Ruiz Capitan, who did all of the character animations, as well as a number of free game assets found online, I was able to focus on designing the game itself rather than the art which is something I struggle with. A full list of game asset creators can be found in the credits of the game.
